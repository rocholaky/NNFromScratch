NNFromScratch
With the rise of Neural Networks, Back propagation (BP) has been handled by AI frameworks such us Pytorch or Tensorflow. With the use of this frameworks the need of actually understanding how BP works has lost importance. To show how BP is computed I creted this repository, in order to create Neural Networks using just the Numpy Library.

Installation
In order to run the nn package you only need python 3.6> or higher the numpy library, pandas and sklearn (we will train the Neural Network on the iris dataset).

In order to install this librarys run the following commands

  pip install numpy pandas sklearn
With this code runned you just need to enter the jupyter notebook and run the example.
